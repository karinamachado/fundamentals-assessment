#Self Assessment (Objects)

**We have defined an object variable `myBook` for you, which has 4 properties**


 Using whichever notation you choose (bracket or dot notation), change each value of `myBook` to reflect the following:

* [ x] Title of myBook is "My Autobiography" (string)

* [ x] Cover of myBook is "paperback" (string)

* [x ] myBook has 320 pages (number)

* [ ] It's `true` that I own this book (boolean)

-

* [ ] Using whichever notation, add a property "inStores" and assign it the value `false`

* [ ] Create a proper loop to display each key value pair (property name and property value).
